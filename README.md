# Zoom-Subscription-Analysis
This project analyzes Zoom’s subscription performance from 2020 to 2021 using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The visualizations highlight how sales evolved across plan types, billing periods, and global regions during and after the pandemic surge. By combining quarterly summaries with weekly trends, the dashboard uncovers shifts in customer behavior and identifies patterns that can guide product strategy, pricing decisions, and regional growth opportunities.

## Key Metrics
* Sales: Overall revenue generated from Pro, Business, and Enterprise subscription plans.
* Plan Type: Categories include Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans.
* Plan Period: Subscription duration—Monthly or Annual.
* Plan Region: Geographic segments—APAC, NA, LATAM, and EMEA.

## Insights
__Type of Plan__
* At the start of the epidemic, enterprise subscriptions saw a sharp increase, peaking at $226K in a single week.  But during the summers of 2020 and 2021, there were discernible drops in this momentum.
 By late 2021, business projections indicate an almost total decline, indicating possible product gaps or increased competition in that market.

__Plan Duration__
* Over 90% of all bookings are for annual plans, although they exhibit a distinct decline toward the end of 2021; monthly subscriptions do not follow this trend.

__Plan Area__
* North America accounted for almost two-thirds of all weekly bookings in the early months of COVID-19.  This area was the source of the most of the Enterprise plan surge.

## Proposed Next Steps
* Examine the annual decline in Enterprise subscribers throughout the summer.  Examine other years to see if the declines are caused by the epidemic or if they are a part of a seasonal trend.  To reduce these drops, investigate possible improvements to the product.
* To combat the declining trend shown by the end of 2021, take into account targeted promotions, trial extensions, or renewal incentives, as yearly plans have a significant impact on overall income.
* EMEA exhibits the greatest degree of volatility despite relatively consistent regional performance.  To increase consistency, look at possibilities for region-specific features or marketing initiatives.
